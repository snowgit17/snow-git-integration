From veeva valut we heave safety info by two ways, one is schedule data expoert and another is direct data API. Schedule data export will send data to S3 bucket so we have to integrate SDE with S3 by setting up the policies and by setting up the service account to acees SDE location that is the place where safety will push the data for every 15 min so SDE holds a location  where safety will push the data for every 15 min  we have to integrate SDE with S3 by setting up the policies and by setting up the service account. NOw in order to acees the data in s3 by snow we have to create external stage in snowflake. In snow stage all the external table will be present which will be pointing to s3 bucket th' ext stage. Stage hold ext table and all these are recreatable. From stage to pre-governed layer we have the accelerator framework which will be triggering as soon as the external tbl got created in stagge and upon trigetting i.e RDGDP reaserch and development which is to transform and the data from pre-governed, governed and integrated.we read data from stage and insert in to pre G and PG is schema which will be preserving the roles the dta that is coming to RDGDP from pG to G only latest data will be taken to GL. For example if we are doing for the 1st time data that is present in s3 on top of that stg table is created  which will reading data from s3. From stg to PG for the 1st time all PG table will be created and all data from pG will be taken to G and integrated. For the 2nd run because stge is a re-creatable we cant aceess yesterdays data only todays data will be accessible which will come after 15 min will be available in stage and insert data into PG and PG will reserve all the roles and from PG to G only todays data will be forward so GL has todays and yesterdays daya but PG has only todays data and GL we will have master table copy that will have all the data and integrated layer SCD 1 table will show latest data so int table will show 2 types of data based on load types . For example if object is full int will show only latest ingestion data so  most of our safety objects are incremental so we do not do full load unless we perform data back fill activity
